","ABOUT THE BURSARY PROVIDER – HCI RESOURCES
Established in 2006 by HCI in partnership with Khusela Women Investments Pty Ltd (KWI), HCI Resources is a junior mining company focused on the acquisition, development, and extraction of mineral resources for local and export markets. The company holds prospecting rights for the Palesa, Mbali, and Nokuhle reserves, all located in South Africa. In 2010, KWI divested its remaining 20% stake in HCI Resources, resulting in it becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of HCI. The company operates from its head office in Midrand, South Africa, with its  coal mining activities concentrated primarily in the Mpumalanga Province.
The Palesa Coal Mine, situated 37 kilometers north of Bronkhorstspruit, is part of the Thembisile Hani Local Municipality, which shares a border with Nkangala Township in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality. The Department of Mineral Resources granted mining rights for sections of the Loopspruit 435 JR farm in June 2008. Mining operations commenced in 2009, starting with a supply of 4,653 tons of coal to Eskom. In 2014, the Department of Mineral Resources issued an additional mining right for portions of the Rooipoort 440 JR farms.

","ABOUT THE BURSARY PROVIDER – NEDBANK
The history of Nedbank dates back to 1831 when the Cape of Good Hope Bank was established. Following numerous name changes; structural changes and rebranding; the Nedbank Group was then formed in 2003.
As one of the four largest banks in South Africa, Nedbank is also one of the newest. The bank is present in 6 countries within the Southern African Development Community (SADC), as well as owning banks and subsidiaries in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi and Lesotho.
The services offered by the bank include wholesale and retail banking services, wealth management offering,  insurance and asset management.
In 1969, Nedbank listed their ordinary shares on the JSE Limited – today they are within the “Top 40” companies on the JSE and boast a market capitalisation of R93 billion.
 
ABOUT THE NEDBANK BURSARY PROGRAMME – FIELDS COVERED
Nedbank is inviting students to apply for their External Bursary Programme, for the 2025 academic year.
Bursaries will be awarded for studies towards a first Undergraduate or Honours degree, to address scarce-skills shortages in the country, with a specific focus on  Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) and Green Economy skills.
Green Economy skills are areas of study focused on improving social well-being and social equity, as well as greatly reducing environmental risks and ecological insufficiency (including reduction of carbon emissions and pollution, enhancing natural capital and increasing energy and materials efficiency).
Nedbank will be awarding bursaries to academically deserving students, in financial need, who are studying or wish to study but are lacking the financial means to do so.

No – bursary recipients will NOT be required to pay back their bursary.
Some bursary providers require students to work for their company after graduation, for an equal duration of time as funding received. This is beneficial to both the bursary provider and the bursary recipient, as the student has guaranteed employment after completion of their studies and the chance to gain invaluable work experience.
 
HOW DO I KNOW IF A BURSARY IS LEGITIMATE OR A SCAM?
At SA Bursaries, we aim to ensure that every bursary we publish is legitimate. If you are ever asked to pay money to submit a bursary application, this is an indication that the bursary is not legitimate. If the bursary application requires you to send your application forms and documents to a free email account (ie gmail, yahoo, hotmail etc), then it is likely a scam – application emails will always be required to be sent to the companies official email addresses. If you ever have any concern that a bursary could be a scam, please let us know so that we can further investigate this.

","ABOUT THE BURSARY PROVIDER – SASA
The South African Sommeliers Association (SASA) is a major front-runner in the food and beverage industry of South Africa. The association was first established in 2010 when a group of aspiring individuals had the common goal of uplifting and promoting the service of wine within the country. SASA is a non-profit organization, aimed at aiding service industry professionals and providing internationally recognised Sommelier qualifications to its various members. SASA also orchestrates competitions in alternating years, aiming to find the best young and new Sommelier. SASA is a proud member of the ASI (Association de la Sommellerie Internationale) which is a globally recognised Sommelier body. With the aid of ASI, SASA is able to communicate with associates from various countries and act as an official representation of its prestigious membership within South Africa.
 
ABOUT THE SASA BURSARY PROGRAMME – FIELDS COVERED
The South African Sommeliers Association (SASA), partnered with Perron X Heritage Collection, are inviting students to apply for their bursary programme. 100 bursaries will be awarded for SASA’s Introductory Sommelier Certification program. (Read about becoming a sommelier with SASA).
The programme is specifically designed to provide aspiring young sommeliers with the basic tools and experience needed to succeed within the wine industry, as well as increase diversity within the South African wine market.
This initiative created by SASA and Perron X is essential to the growth of the South African wine industry, as the profession of sommeliers have often been associated with exclusivity and lack of diversity. SASSA and Peron X hopes to address this issue by allowing students from various backgrounds the opportunity to become aspiring sommeliers, thus not only representing various communities, but also introducing a new range of quality and service.

MORE ABOUT THE FMR BURSARY COMPETITION – RULES & REGULATIONS

and arrangement of the pieces, as well as leadership within the ensemble.

","ABOUT THE BURSARY PROVIDER – GARDEN CITIES
Garden Cities was established in 1919 in South Africa, by businessman and politician Richard Stuttaford, who took inspiration from Sir Ebenezer Howard, a British urban planner who proposed that new towns should be planned to provide pleasant living environments for people who lived in the slums during and after the first World War.
Over 100 years later, Garden Cities has been involved in many housing developments, inclduing: Pinelands Garden City, Meadowridge Garden City, Square Hill Garden City, Elfindale Garden City, Edgemead Garden City, Northpine Garden City, Dennemere Garden City and Victoria Park Garden City, to name a few.
All profits made by the company are reinvested into the company and in previous years, funds were used to buy land for future developments. Recently, Garden Cities have used their profits to build school halls and to provide  science laboratories in under-resourced schools in the Western Cape province.

","ABOUT THE BURSARY PROVIDER – WINTER CEREAL TRUST
The Winter Cereal Trust (WCT), founded in 1997, is divided into 2 trusts – the Winter Cereal Research Trust and the Winter Cereal General Trust, each serving a separate function.
The aim of the Winter Cereal Research Trust is to participate in research about winter cereal and South Africa’s interest within the industry. Winter cereals consist of  wheat, oats, barley, rye, triticale and durum wheat. While the aim of the Winter Cereal General Trust is to provide funding for research (including technical, industrial and  scientific research) into the production of winter cereals within South Africa.
The Winter Cereal Trust (WCT) initiated the bursary scheme in 2006 to financially assist students in the small grains research industry.
 
ABOUT THE WINTER CEREAL TRUST BURSARY PROGRAMME – FIELDS COVERED
The Winter Cereal Trust (WCT) is inviting students to apply for bursary funding for the 2023 academic year. Bursaries are awarded each year, for Masters and Doctoral studies in fields relevant to the Small Grains Industry. The bursary will fund thesis topics that have been approved by the Winter Cereal Trust.
The following bursaries will be awarded by the WCT:

The Trust aims to award 10 bursaries each year, to postgraduate students pursuing a Masters or Doctoral qualification in a Small Grains-related field.
The Trust also aims to award 3 bursaries each year, to final year undergraduate and/of honours students who intend to pursue postgraduate studies in a Small Grains-related field, up to a minimum of MSc degree level (this is subject to availability of funds).
